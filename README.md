# Markets dotfiles

These are some config files (git, bash, aliases, ruby, sublime text 2, ...) to set up some settings that I like it.

## Installation

Run this:

```
git clone https://github.com/markets/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
script/install
```

Alternatively, to install it avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```
script/install -f # or --force
```

To update it, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` folder and run again:

```
script/install
```

Enjoy it!
